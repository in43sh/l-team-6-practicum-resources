# Sonix Stitch Prompt

The key to consistency is front-loading every design decision so Stitch has no room to improvise.

## Prompt

```text
Design a web application called Sonix — an audio visualizer platform where users connect audio sources and watch real-time visual effects synchronized to the sound.

---

GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS (apply to every single screen without exception)
- Never invent colors outside the approved palette below
- Never use font sizes outside the type scale below
- Never use spacing values outside the spacing scale below
- Never use a design pattern on one screen that contradicts another screen
- Desktop is the canonical product definition and source of truth for layout, hierarchy, and functionality
- Primary artboards should be 1440px wide, 900px tall
- The navigation bar is context-aware — its content varies by page type (see NAV VARIANTS); authenticated screens do NOT all share the same nav layout
- Footer behavior is also context-aware — do not apply one footer pattern to every page
- The visualizer screen uses a minimal 48px nav to maximize canvas space; all other authenticated screens use a standard 64px nav
- Dark theme is the only required MVP presentation
- ALL screens must be responsive — provide layout notes for desktop (1440px), laptop (1280px), tablet (768px), and phone (375px)

---

DESIGN SYSTEM

Dark theme palette (default and canonical):
- Background:       #0A0A0F
- Surface:          #12121A  (cards, panels, sidebars)
- Surface elevated: #1C1C28  (dropdowns, tooltips, active states)
- Primary accent:   #7C5CFC  (electric purple — primary buttons, active borders, focus rings)
- Secondary accent: #00E5FF  (cyan — secondary highlights, tags, waveform details)
- Text primary:     #F0F0FF
- Text secondary:   #8888AA
- Error:            #FF4D6D
- Success:          #00D68F
- Border:           #2A2A3D
- Overlay:          rgba(10, 10, 15, 0.8)  (modal backdrops, canvas overlays)

Typography (Inter font family, all weights):
- Display: 48px / 700 / letter-spacing -0.02em
- H1:      32px / 600 / letter-spacing -0.01em
- H2:      24px / 600
- H3:      18px / 500
- Body:    14px / 400 / line-height 1.6
- Caption: 12px / 400 / text-secondary color

Spacing scale (4px base unit — use only these values):
4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 96, 128

Layout grid:
- 12-column grid
- Column gutter: 24px
- Outer margin: 80px on each side
- Max content width: 1280px, centered

Responsive strategy:
- Design desktop first, then adapt the same product system to laptop, tablet, and phone
- ALL screens must be responsive — never produce a desktop-only design
- On smaller screens, stack columns, collapse sidebars into drawers or sheets, and move secondary panels below primary content
- The visualizer canvas remains the dominant element on all screen sizes
- On tablet/phone, the bottom control bar stacks into two rows or collapses secondary controls into a "More" menu
- If a feature is uncertain on smaller screens, label it "Desktop preferred" rather than silently removing it
- Do not assume microphone routing, virtual audio input, fullscreen behavior, or keyboard shortcuts work on all devices
- Preserve the same visual language, typography, colors, spacing, and component rules across all breakpoints

Theme scope:
- Dark theme is the default MVP presentation and the only required artboard theme
- Do not generate light-theme artboards or an active appearance toggle in the MVP screens
- If stretch-goal states are shown, light theme can appear only as a future concept, not an active setting

Tailwind implementation constraints:
- This product will be implemented in React with Tailwind CSS
- Design every screen to map cleanly to reusable React components and Tailwind utility classes
- Prefer repeated token values over one-off spacing, sizing, or radius decisions
- Favor layout patterns that can be built with flex, grid, gap, padding, max-width, and responsive breakpoints
- Reuse the same button, input, card, tag, and navigation patterns across all screens
- Keep decorative effects layered on top of simple layout structure rather than requiring highly custom CSS
- Use shared component values and variants that map directly to Tailwind theme values or CSS variables

Accessibility and usability rules:
- Maintain WCAG AA contrast for body text, controls, borders, and focus states
- Never rely on color alone to communicate status; always pair color with labels, icons, or helper text
- All interactive controls must have visible keyboard focus on desktop
- Minimum touch target for tablet and phone: 44×44px
- Respect reduced-motion preferences by reducing ambient animation, glows, and non-essential movement
- Hotkey indicators are supplementary — never the only affordance; always pair with visible tooltips

Border radius:
- Small (inputs, buttons, list items): 8px
- Medium (cards, panels):              12px
- Large (modals, feature panels):      16px
- Pill (tags, badges, avatars):        999px

Elevation / glow (no traditional drop shadows):
- Resting:  none
- Hover:    0 0 12px rgba(124, 92, 252, 0.25)
- Active:   0 0 20px rgba(124, 92, 252, 0.45)
- Cyan glow (secondary): 0 0 12px rgba(0, 229, 255, 0.2)

Iconography:
- Style: line icons, 1.5px stroke
- Size: 16px inline, 20px standalone, 24px nav/action

---

LOGO

Logo mark:
- Shape: three horizontal bars of unequal length (short / long / medium, top to bottom), each with fully rounded ends — reads as a waveform silhouette and as a stylized "S" letterform
- Colors: all three bars in primary accent #7C5CFC; the longest (middle) bar has a subtle #00E5FF right-end glow
- The three bars have 4px vertical spacing between them; bar height is 4px each
- The overall icon bounding box is approximately 20×20px at nav size

Wordmark:
- "SONIX" in Inter 700, all caps, #7C5CFC, tracking 0.05em
- Always rendered in the same color as the icon — never split colors between icon and wordmark

Combined lockup (icon + wordmark):
- 8px gap between icon and wordmark
- Use on: public pages, standard authenticated nav, onboarding tour

Icon only (no wordmark):
- Use on: visualizer nav (minimized), favicon, mobile nav
- Never distort, recolor, or add effects beyond the defined glow

Usage sizes:
- 16px icon height — favicon / tab icon
- 24px icon height — visualizer nav (icon-only mode)
- 32px icon height with wordmark — standard nav, card headers

---

STATIC PAGES

The application contains the following pages:
1.  /           — Landing page (public)
2.  /signup     — Sign up (public)
3.  /login      — Log in (public)
4.  /about      — About Sonix (public)
5.  /privacy    — Privacy policy (public)
6.  /terms      — Terms of service (public)
7.  /visualizer — Main visualizer (authenticated)
8.  /explore    — Explore visuals / global library (authenticated)
9.  /favorites  — My favorited visuals (authenticated)
10. /settings   — User settings (authenticated)
11. /404        — Error / not found (public)

Route rules:
- Public site pages should expose Privacy and Terms in the footer so the legal pages are always reachable
- About should remain part of the public marketing navigation rather than footer-only

---

ANIMATED BACKGROUNDS

Landing page hero:
- Two large radial gradient orbs — one #7C5CFC (top-right corner) and one #00E5FF (bottom-left corner) — at ~15% opacity against #0A0A0F
- Animation: the orbs drift slowly (20–30s full cycle), shifting position by ~5–8% and oscillating in opacity between 10–20% — smooth, looping
- Effect reads as a slow aurora breathing effect; remains dark and moody, not bright
- Reduced-motion fallback: static gradient, no animation

Login and Sign Up pages:
- Background: #0A0A0F base
- Subtle animated particle field: 20–30 small dots (1–2px diameter, #8888AA color, 25% opacity) drifting slowly upward with slight horizontal drift, low density, random placement
- Dots loop seamlessly when they exit the top edge
- Reduced-motion fallback: static #0A0A0F background, no particles

---

HOTKEYS (desktop only)

Keyboard shortcuts are only active on /visualizer in the MVP. Other authenticated screens may expose a "Keyboard Shortcuts" help entry, but they must not bind playback or visualizer keys globally.

Visualizer screen keyboard shortcuts:
- Space  — Play / Pause visual switching
- F      — Toggle fullscreen
- S      — Toggle shuffle
- ←      — Previous visual
- →      — Next visual
- H      — Toggle favorite (heart)
- D      — Open device selector dropdown
- ? or K — Open keyboard shortcuts overlay

UI treatment:
- Every button tooltip in the control bar shows the hotkey inline: e.g., "Play  [Space]" or "Fullscreen  [F]"
- Hotkey badge style: monospace, 11px, surface background, 2px border #2A2A3D, 4px border radius, text-secondary color — rendered as a small kbd chip next to the tooltip label
- ? key opens a centered modal: "Keyboard Shortcuts" — two-column grid of action/shortcut pairs grouped by category (Playback, Navigation, Display); ghost close button top-right
- On tablet and phone: hotkeys are not available; tooltips do not show keyboard badges; no hotkey modal is accessible

---

TOUR COMPONENT (first-login onboarding)

Triggered automatically on first login only. Not shown on subsequent visits (stored in user preferences). Only shown on the visualizer screen.

Overlay:
- Full-screen semi-transparent backdrop: rgba(10, 10, 15, 0.85)

COMPONENT SPECIFICATIONS

NAV VARIANTS (pages that use a full navbar must use the correct variant — no exceptions)

The navbar stays as consistent as possible across pages. Variants exist only where layout context strictly requires it. For a fully distraction-free visualizer experience, users can enter fullscreen mode — no need for more nav variants.

Variant A — Public marketing (landing, about):
- Height: 64px
- Background: surface #12121A, 1px bottom border #2A2A3D
- Left: logo lockup (icon + wordmark)
- Center: nav links "Features / About" in body text, text-secondary; active link has #7C5CFC underline
- Right: "Log In" ghost button (32px) + "Sign Up" primary button (32px), 12px gap between

Variant B — Public minimal (login, signup):
- Height: 64px, same background
- Left: logo lockup only
- Center: empty
- Right: empty
(The form is the page — no secondary navigation needed)

Variant C — Authenticated standard (explore, favorites, settings):
- Height: 64px, same background
- Left: logo lockup (links to /visualizer)
- Center: empty
- Right: user avatar (32px circle, gradient fill #7C5CFC→#00E5FF) + "Alex Rivera" (body text) + chevron-down icon; clicking opens user modal

Variant D — Visualizer (maximized canvas, minimal chrome):
- Height: 48px
- Background: surface #12121A, NO bottom border (reduces visual separation from canvas)
- Left: logo icon only (24px height, no wordmark, links to /visualizer)
- Center: empty
- Right (16px from edge): hamburger/menu icon (24px, text-secondary) + 16px gap + user avatar icon (32px circle, no username text)
- Hamburger opens a side-drawer nav; user avatar opens the user modal

User modal (opened from user avatar in Variant C and D):
- Floating panel, 240px wide, right-aligned below trigger, 8px from right edge
- Surface-elevated background, 16px radius, 8px inner padding, 1px #2A2A3D border, purple glow
- Top row: avatar (32px) + name (body/500)
- 1px #2A2A3D divider, 8px below top row
- Menu items (36px each, icon left + label, sidebar interaction states):
  - Settings — gear icon
  - Keyboard Shortcuts — keyboard icon (opens hotkey modal)
  - 1px divider
  - Log Out — exit icon, #FF4D6D text color

Hamburger side-drawer (Variant D only):
- Width: 240px, slides in from left, surface background, 1px right border #2A2A3D
- Items: Visualizer / Explore / My Favorites / Settings — sidebar interaction states
- Closes on backdrop click or Escape key

FOOTER VARIANTS (apply the correct footer behavior per page type)

Variant A — Public site footer (landing, about, 404):
- Height: 64px
- Background: surface #12121A, 1px top border #2A2A3D
- Left: "© 2025 Sonix" — caption, text-secondary
- Right: legal links "Privacy / Terms" plus optional lightweight product links such as "About"; caption text, text-secondary, 24px gaps

Variant B — Public auth / legal footer (login, signup, privacy, terms):
- Minimal footer treatment; do not let it compete with the main form or legal document content
- Can be a centered caption row with "Privacy / Terms" links, 48px tall, text-secondary
- On /privacy or /terms, the current page link can use text-primary while the other remains text-secondary

Variant C — Authenticated app footer (explore, favorites, settings):
- Default to no persistent footer unless the screen needs one for layout balance
- If shown, keep it compact, secondary, and non-marketing in tone

Variant D — Visualizer immersive (/visualizer):

Scrollbars (all scrollable regions):
- Width: 4px
- Track: transparent
- Thumb: #2A2A3D, 999px radius
- Thumb hover: #7C5CFC

Behavior and state rules:
- Every major screen should feel designed for loading, empty, success, and error states

- Visualizer permission state: clear microphone-access prompt, primary action, short helper text
- Visualizer denied state: explain audio access was blocked; offer retry or change-device actions
- Audio-disconnected state: preserve selected visual, pause reactivity, show non-destructive notice
- Visual library empty-search state: "No visuals match your filters" with a reset-filters action
- Favorites empty state: encourage exploring visuals and hearting them rather than showing a blank list
- On tablet and phone, uncertain features may be labeled "Desktop preferred" instead of being silently removed

5. MAIN VISUALIZER SCREEN  (authenticated, /visualizer)

Nav: Variant D (48px, icon-only)
Footer: Variant D (none)

Goal: give maximum viewport area to the visualizer canvas. No sidebars. No static panels.

Layout stack (top to bottom, fills 1440×900):
- Nav bar: 48px
- Canvas layer: 852px tall × 1440px wide (fills all remaining viewport)
  - Bottom control bar is a semi-transparent overlay at the bottom of the canvas — NOT a separate layout row

Canvas:
- Fills 1440×852px below the nav
- Background: #000000
- Default state: three concentric ellipses in accent purple (#7C5CFC) and cyan (#00E5FF), fading toward center — suggesting audio waveform
- No audio connected caption: "No audio connected" in caption text, text-secondary, bottom-center of canvas

Hover watermark:
- Appears when cursor hovers the canvas and is NOT within the bottom 100px (control bar zone)
- Position: bottom-left of canvas, 16px from bottom, 16px from left edge
- Card: 200px wide, rgba(28,28,40,0.9) background with backdrop-blur, 12px radius, 16px padding, 1px #2A2A3D border

Ticker / visual marquee:
- 28px height strip, full canvas width
- Position: within canvas, pinned just above the bottom control bar overlay
- Background: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(10,10,15,0.7), transparent)
- Content: single-line scrolling text — "Aurora Wave  ●  Microphone — Built-in  ●  Now Playing"
- Font: 12px / 400, text-secondary, letter-spacing 0.02em

- Auto-hides with the control bar; visible whenever cursor moves

Bottom control bar (canvas overlay):
- Height: 72px
- Position: absolute, pinned to bottom of canvas, full 1440px width
- Background: linear-gradient(to top, rgba(10,10,15,0.97) 60%, transparent)
- Visibility: fades in on cursor movement; fades out after 3s of inactivity; always visible when audio is disconnected; never hides in reduced-motion mode

  - 16px gap
  - Play/Pause (48px circle button, primary accent bg, #F0F0FF icon, purple glow) — tooltip: "Play / Pause  [Space]"; currently shows pause icon (auto-switching every 10s is active); this is the most prominent control

Responsive notes:
- Tablet: control bar stacks into two rows (row 1: playback center controls; row 2: device + sensitivity + right-zone icons); canvas scales to full available width
- Phone: canvas is full screen; control bar auto-hides more aggressively; device selector collapses into a "···" more button

- Unauthenticated visitors can use the visualizer for 5–10 minutes; after the timer expires a "Sign up to continue" banner appears
- Banner: full-width, surface-elevated background, 1px #2A2A3D border, pinned to the top of the canvas; body copy: "You've been visualizing for 5 minutes — sign up free to keep going."; CTA: "Sign Up" primary button + "Dismiss" ghost button (hides banner for a short interval before reappearing); does not block the canvas
- Banner does not appear for authenticated users

Playlists (post-MVP):
- Stub the "Add to Playlist" entry point in the control bar right zone as a disabled (+) icon button with tooltip "Add to Playlist — coming soon"
- No playlist modal, no /playlists or /playlists/:id routes in MVP design

AI visual generation:
- Accessible from Explore Visuals page as a special card at the top of the grid: "AI Visual Generation" card with a gradient purple/cyan thumbnail, "Coming Soon" overlay pill
- Tooltip on hover: "Describe a visual and AI generates it live — coming soon"

Letters/reactive text (over stretch):
- Represents real-time reactive typography — shown as a single visual card in the library labeled "Reactive Text" with a "Preview" button; no full design spec required

Light theme / appearance toggle:
- Do not implement as an active MVP control
- If referenced at all, show it only as a roadmap or future-feature concept, not as a usable setting

---

TONE AND COPY RULES
- Product name: always "Sonix" — capital S, lowercase remaining — never "SONIX" in body copy (only the wordmark uses all-caps styling)
- Visual names (use these exact strings everywhere): "Aurora Wave", "Spectrum Pulse", "Deep Bass Bloom", "Neon Lattice", "Void Drift", "Solar Flare", "Crystal Echo", "Fractal Storm"
- Playlist names (for future reference / post-MVP): "Late Night Sessions", "Bass Heavy", "Ambient Drift" — do not display in MVP screens
- No lorem ipsum anywhere — every text string must be plausible product copy
- Username: "Alex Rivera" with a 32px circular avatar (gradient fill: #7C5CFC to #00E5FF)
- All copy must feel earnest and confident — not salesy; no exclamation marks
- Hotkey tooltips format: "Action Label  [Key]" — one space between label and badge

---

OUTPUT REQUIREMENT
Generate all 11 screens as a single unified design file. Desktop dark-theme artboards are the required MVP artboards. All screens must be responsive — include layout notes or separate artboards for laptop (1280px), tablet (768px), and phone (375px). Do not generate active light-theme screens or an appearance toggle for the MVP. Every screen must use identical type sizes, identical component styles, and consistent color values. If any screen contradicts another, it is wrong.
```

## Why This Works Better Than Short Prompts

- Hex codes and exact pixel dimensions eliminate color and spacing drift between generations.
- `GLOBAL CONSTRAINTS` at the top is the first thing Stitch reads — it anchors all decisions before screen details begin.
- Context-aware nav variants prevent Stitch from applying one nav pattern everywhere; each page specifies exactly which variant to use.
- The visualizer screen's canvas-maximized layout (no sidebars, overlay control bar) is spelled out in exact pixel math, leaving no room for Stitch to add sidebars back.
- Bottom control bar zones (left/center/right) are precisely defined with pixel widths, control names, hotkey tooltips, and interaction states — preventing improvised layouts.
- The hover watermark and ticker/marquee are specified as canvas overlays with exact positioning, size, and animation rules.
- Explicit interaction states (hover/focus/active/disabled/locked) prevent Stitch from inventing component variants per screen.
- Animated background specs are tied to specific pages and include reduced-motion fallbacks.
- Hotkey system is defined once at the global level with badge style, tooltip format, and per-screen scope rules.
- Tour component steps are enumerated with exact target elements, copy, and card layout — making it buildable directly from the spec.
- Paywall rules are in a single `PAYWALL / TIER RULES` section that applies globally, rather than scattered per-screen.
- Stretch features are represented as design states (coming-soon, locked, disabled) rather than omitted — keeping the design coherent without specifying unbuilt behavior.
- Static pages list gives Stitch the full product map upfront so no screen exists in isolation.
- Fixed copy strings (visual names, username) prevent text drift across all 11 screens.
- The output requirement at the end reinforces the constraints as the last thing read.
